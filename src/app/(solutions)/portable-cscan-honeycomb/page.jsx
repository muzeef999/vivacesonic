            This <strong>portable ultrasonic inspection system</strong> is specifically designed for inspecting 
            <strong> honeycomb panels made of aluminum and carbon-based materials</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It features a set of <strong>dry contact manual probes</strong> operating in 
            <strong>through transmission mode</strong>, allowing operators to scan manually and generate accurate 
            <strong> C-Scan images</strong> of the panel structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The compact design and flexible probe handling make it ideal for field inspections and non-lab environments.

            This system was <strong>custom-designed</strong> for the inspection of <strong>composite shells</strong> using
            specially built <strong>Dry Coupled Ultrasonic Probes</strong>, which were developed in-house.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inspection results are presented in <strong>C-Scan image format</strong>, enabling users to quickly analyze
            defect parameters such as <strong>length, location, and area</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its multi-axis mechanism ensures complete coverage of complex shell geometries with consistent contact and accuracy.

            This ultrasonic system measures <strong>case depth in induction-hardened crankshafts</strong> by analyzing
            <strong> backscattered ultrasonic signals</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It utilizes a set of <strong>two transducers</strong> to cover larger crankshaft sections and supports accurate
            case depth measurement even at <strong>fillet corners</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system enables <strong>continuous monitoring along the circumference</strong> and uses
            <strong> advanced signal processing</strong> to differentiate between <strong>martensite to ferrite-pearlite</strong>
            and <strong>martensite to martensite</strong> transitions in the grain structure.

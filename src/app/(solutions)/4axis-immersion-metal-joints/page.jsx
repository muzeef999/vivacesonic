            For ultrasonic evaluation of the bonding between dissimilar materials using high-frequency focused transducers, 
            the results are presented in real-time <strong>A-scan</strong> and <strong>C-scan</strong> views along with total data capture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further analysis and measurement are performed to comprehensively evaluate the bond strength using
            <strong> A, B, and C-scan imaging techniques</strong>.

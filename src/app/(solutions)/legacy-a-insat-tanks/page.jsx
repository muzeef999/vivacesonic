          <p>
            This ultrasonic immersion testing system was developed to inspect 
            <strong> electron-beam welded joints</strong> in critical components of INSAT tanks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system was <strong>fully designed, manufactured, and installed</strong> in-house with precision mechanics 
            and features such as <strong>vacuum-assisted tank holders</strong> for stable and efficient testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It represents a significant milestone in automation for space-grade component testing.
